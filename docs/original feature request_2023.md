Context:
Problem: people hire contractors, and the contractor takes the money without finishing the job or doing the job without the expected quality, or the contractor does a job well done but is having difficulty collecting the money from the customer. Proposed solution: an app that serves as an escrow payment account where the customer, after selecting the contractor, getting a quote from the contractor, and signing a binding agreement with the contractor, we save the customer money, and once the job is completed, the contractor gets paid. If there is any job dissatisfaction, the contractor and the customer must agree before our app releases the payment. From that payment, we take a cut. The proposed app will serve as an escrow account, gather contractor reviews, and make recommendations to potential customers. Confidential
